## About the Project
Have you wanted to know what you should read next based on a previous read? Have you wanted to be able read the reviews of a book? Have you ever wanted to see a graph of how relavant books are to eachother?
<br />
Well, look no further!! LitLabyrinth is an interactive book recommendation system with a fully functioning GUI and a graph visualization of book relavance. 
DISCLAIMER: This project works with a dataset of books not with all the books in the world. All reviews are entirely fictional.
